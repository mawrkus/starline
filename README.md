# üí´ Starline [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](#contribute)

Visualize the timeline of the stars given to any GitHub repository. I. e. the number of stars given on any given day.

This package uses the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/starring/) to collect all the star creation timestamps. The data is visualized thanks to [D3](https://d3js.org/).

## Installation

The package needs **node >= 6** and for now, can be installed via `git clone` only (for now):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/mawrkus/starline.git
$ cd starline
$ npm install
```
At this stage you will need to generate a personal access token. This can be easily done by logging in to GitHub then `Profile Settings > Personal access token`. Once generated, place it in a `.env` file:

```shell
$ echo GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=[your github access token] > .env
```

Check [GitHub's documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/) for more information about the API and authentication in general.

## Usage

```shell
$ npm start
```

Open a Web browser, go to `http://localhost:8000`, et voil√†!

Is the repository sleepy, trendy, steady or just dead? I hope this tool will help.

## Background

This small project started out of curiosity: why always considering the number of stars of a GitHub project without considering *when* they were given? After playing a while with GitHub's API, I decided to dig in.

Ideas for a future roadmap:

- Contrast the starline with other activities by adding more graphs: release dates, commits, PR, ...
- Playing more with the visualizations/trying other visualizations libraries
